<div class=subtitles><h2>A little information about me..</h2></div>
<p>
Hi, my name is Matthew Ackerley. I am 30 years old, born on the 20th of June, 1989. I currently live in Standish, Wigan. This was only a temporary living situation up until the current events of the global pandemic of Corvid-19 made it more permanent. My hobbies include computer gaming (this may be better described as an addiction), archery and rock climbing (bouldering specifically).</p>
    
<p>I have only worked in two companies throughout my life - the first being an Architectâ€™s in which I started as an apprentice (Business Administration NVQ) and stayed on afterwards. I worked there for 10 years and took on more roles and responsibilities as time went on eventually accumulating in managing their IT systems, drawing of architectural plans, site visits and surveys and general office duties. After 10 years here I needed a change as there was no chance of progression (small company) and little variety in day to day activities. </p>
    
<p>The second company I worked for was a textiles company in which my duties were managing all incoming orders and deliveries of the sales team of 8, managing the production and import of certain products the company sold (fabric books, mini-curtains etc) and again general office duties. As time progressed I realised this was not something I would want to do for a prolonged period of time. This has led me to look at re-training and how I have arrived at the Codenation coding course - something I enjoyed at college but that there was no specific course for.</p>

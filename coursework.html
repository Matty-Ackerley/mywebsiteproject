<div class=subtitles><h2>UNIT 1 - OUTCOME 1</h2>
<h3>1.1 - DESCRIBING THE PURPOSE OF "IT" IN MODERN BUSINESS:</h3>
</div>
<div class=panel><p>
Information Technology can serve many different purposes in modern business. To name a few of the most obvious to me would be Communication, Efficiency and the Systems that IT allows.</p>
       
 <p>It provides an ever-growing range of methods for companies to communicate with employees and customers. These can include websites, e-mail and online video or audio calls (variety of programs). This is why most smart phones or computers you can buy on the market today come with a range of these products already installed and ready to use. Easier communication makes the completion of a task or an order/inquiry so much quicker and more efficient than if you were limited to, for example, a face to face meeting. The ability to check in constantly and receive an update of the progress ensures that the task is being completed correctly, on time and to the standards agreed.</p>
       
<p>The use of systems is wide-ranging and can be anything from stock control, data storage and recall (not limited to being in the office) and MIS (management information systems)  that allow companies to monitor and display data from sales, costs and timescales. <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/information-technology-its-role-modern-organization-1800.html" target="_blank">[1]</a>

<div class=subtitles><h3>1.2 - DESCRIBING METHODS, SKILLS AND RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE DIGITAL PROJECTS SUCCESSFULLY – WHAT DO YOU NEED TO MAKE PROJECTS SUCCESSFUL? WHAT TOOLS? WHAT SKILLS?</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>
To make any digital project a success you need to plan carefully, manage your time and progress on your tasks and use an appropriate tool (or in our case,program) for the job. There are a multitude of programs and websites assigned to doing these things such as Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio and Draw.io for theplanning stages, Trello, ProofHub and Workzone for project management (using the KanBan method). <a href="https://www.proofhub.com/articles/trello-alternatives"target="_blank">[2]</a></p>
    
<p>The skill and tool would be completely dependent upon what type of digital project you are producing, so if we take a website for example then you would want to be well versed in a web-based language like HTML/CSS, Java/JavaScript or Python to build it yourself. Alternatively you could use a template or “website builder” like Webnode, Wix or Webstarts <a href="https://www.websitetooltester.com/en/blog/best-free-website-builders/" target=_blank">[3]</a> to create a website with less technical knowledge simply using a template and easy to follow prompts and tips to place all of your content.  </p>

<div class=subtitles><h3>1.3 - PLAN AND CARRY OUT TASKS USING "IT" – E.G. MAKING YOUR WEBSITE. HOW WILL YOU PLAN IT?  INCLUDE A LINK TO YOUR TRELLO BOARD.</h3></div>
<div class=panel>
<p>
 Depending upon the level of detail that will be in the website (or project) you may need to use planning software such as flowchart tools (as earlier mentioned) to create an overall picture of the website and relevant content. Project management software such as Trello is always a good idea (and is even being used in the simple answering of these questions for this project <a href=https://trello.com/b/FaFIk0Aq/codenation-projectwebsite-content" target="_blank">[4]</a>) simply because you need to be able to effectively keep track of your progress no matter what it is you are doing. </p>

<div class=subtitles><h3>1.4 - DESCRIBE THE RISKS THAT MIGHT IMPACT DIGITAL PROJECTS – WHAT CAUSES DIGITAL PROJECTS TO FAIL? WHY?</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>
There are many risks involved with digital projects like building a website, these can range from features (or code) not working together, time mismanagement, team members leaving before the product is finished or even your product no longer being as necessary (perhaps somebody releases one before you do?). All of these things can be boiled down into one key point: a failure to plan accordingly. With a proper plan in place you can have a general idea of what to do in the known and the unknown scenarios ahead <a href="https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care" target="_blank">[5]</a>. This will allow you to keep your project on track from start to end. </p>

<div class=subtitles><h3>1.5 - DESCRIBE HOW YOU WOULD GO ABOUT SELECTING AND USING "IT" SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE – HOW DO YOU SELECT THE RIGHT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THE JOB?</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>
When it comes to selecting the right system or software for a project you may already have an idea of what to use from completing similar work before. If said method worked for you then you are likely to re-use it. If you have no personal experience of software that would be appropriate then another team member may have if you are working on a group project. If neither of these are applicable then you can always research online (using search engines like google) the most effective tools people have found for work of a similar nature. There is usually a good description of how the software may be used and can even include examples.</p>

<p>
As a general rule of thumb, people will use what they or a team member are familiar with and know to be successful or failing that being possible, what looks like the most fitting solution based upon research.  
</p></div>

<div class=subtitles><h3> 
1.6 - DESCRIBE AND PROVIDE ANALYSIS ON HOW YOUR CHOSEN TECHNOLOGIES HAVE HELPED YOU ACHIEVE YOUR OUTCOMES. – HOW HAS TRELLO HELPED YOU PLAN AND HOW CAN GIT AND GITHUB HELP WITH YOUR CODES VERSION CONTROL?</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>
A good example of a live project that uses relevant technologies to achieve the finished product would be the game that we developed as a team on the codenation course. We used both Trello <a href="https://trello.com/b/NYeK7Oi6/codenation-project-the-electric-chameleons" target="_blank">[6]</a> and Draw.io <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Id0OfyVK37LFBQ01p-Fv_FpPUHV5lhW7/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">[7]</a> on the request of the tutor.
</p>
<p>
Trello allowed us to keep track of our progress using the Kanban method, assigning tasks to team members accordingly. It also allowed us to keep track of any extra ideas we had but may not have got around to implementing before the deadline.
Draw.io was exceptionally useful in planning out our game, from the initial ideas stage to the timeline of the game (including a brief summary of what each stage would comprise of and the possible choices with their outcomes).
</p>

<p>Whilst I have not yet used it, research shows Github <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/" target="_blank">[8]</a> would have made this project much easier in terms of the compiling of the code and having all relevant bits of the code, image sources and storyline etc in one place. Instead of one person having to compile the code at the end of the project we could have simply written the code we were assigned and solved any errors that came specifically from our input directly. This would have made the project come together more organically instead of having to find solutions to the problems we faced when pulling everything together.

<div class=subtitles><h3>1.7 - DESCRIBE LEGAL GUIDELINES AND CONSTRAINTS THAT IMPACT DIGITAL PROJECTS – HOW DOES GDPR IMPACT DIGITAL PROJECTS?</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>
The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is something that most people have heard of but may not completely understand what it is. It consists of the following rights: <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/gdpr/" target="_blank">[9]</a>
</p>

<ul>
<li>The right of access (the right to view all data a company has collected on you and how it has been used).</li>

<li>The right to be forgotten (this can mean either your data is not collected and stored to begin with or that you withdraw permission for a company to store and use your data).</li>

<li>The right of data portability (the right to transfer your data from one company to another using industry recognised standards).</li>

<li>The right to be informed (a company needs to inform you that your information will be gathered so that you can give explicit permission for this to be done as this cannot be assumed).</li>

<li>The right to have information corrected (this can be either the correction of records that may be wrong or incompleted/out of date).</li>

<li>The right to restrict processing (this would mean that a company cannot use your data for processing but may hold onto the record of it, so long as it is not used).</li>

<li>The right to object (a company must always let you know that you have the right to object at the start of any form of communication). This right also allows you to have a company stop gathering information on you and it must be honoured as soon as the request is made.</li>

<li>The right to be notified (in the event of a data breach such as a hack, the company must inform you within 72 hours of them becoming aware if your data may have been compromised).</li>
</ul>

Keeping in line with our theme of a website as an example of a digital project, a website would have to notify any customers if their information would be stored as a result. It would entail how the individual used the site and for how long.

<div class=subtitle3><h2>UNIT 1, OUTCOME 2 (REVIEW)</h2>
<h3>2.1 REVIEW THE ONGOING USE OF IT TOOLS AND CHANGE APPROACH AS NEEDED – IN MAKING YOUR OWN WEBSITE, ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE TOOLS YOU USED? E.G. VISUAL STUDIO CODE,TRELLO.</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>Without greater knowledge of other tools that may have been appropriate for building a website it is hard to say if there was something that may have been better. Whilst using Trello and Visual Studio Code I have not found that theses program were unable to do something that I wanted them to. The layout and functionality built in makes them very self explanatory and easy to use. This would suggest the tools worked perfectly fine for the task and in this instance I did not need to seek other software out.</p></div>

<div class=subtitle3><h3>2.2 DESCRIBE WHETHER THE IT TOOLS SELECTED WERE APPROPRIATE E.G. VISUAL STUDIO CODE, TRELLO</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>It is my opinion that both Visual Studio Code and Trello were extremely good choices to use in our website building project. With rather limited knowledge and only a little research it was simple to produce a functioning and well styled website (using Trello to keep track of my progress, even though this was not a group project). You are given complete freedom on how to use these tools making it completely suitable to how you work. A quick example would be that with Visual Studio Code you can use a live server plugin to display the changes you are making to your website as you change them. If this is not something you prefer then you can simply leave this off and open/refresh the page as you wish to view the changes.</p></div>

<div class=subtitle3><h3>2.3 ASSESS THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF YOUR FINAL PROJECT – ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOUR WEBSITE? WHY? WHY NOT? YOU SHOULD REVIEW IT ON THE WEBSITE ITSELF IN THE INTERESTS OF OPENNESS. WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE?</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>Considering this is the first website I have built using HTML and CSS (and with only a week of learning on the go) I am happy with how my website has ended up. It is simple and modern and as through testing has worked exactly as I hoped it would.</p>

<p>This being said I know that given more time and research I could still improve the visual aspect on the site and perhaps use other features (like frames) to change how it all ties together.</p></div>

<div class=subtitle3><h3>2.4 DESCRIBE FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS YOU CAN MAKE TO YOUR PROJECT</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>There are of course improvements I would (and will, even after the project ends) make - such as continuing to improve the efficiency and visual attraction, adding collapsible windows to nest text in, more content per page and more pages overall - I am keen to embed the python game our group made on the course, a blog section etc.</p></div>

<div class=subtitle3><h3>2.5 REVIEW OUTCOMES TO MAKE SURE THEY MATCH REQUIREMENTS AND ARE FIT FOR PURPOSE.</h3></div>

<div class=panel><p>There are a few key things to consider when building a website - the first and most obvious one being that the content you are using is appropriate for whatever your site will be used for. As my website project is a brief introduction to me and a place to practice my website building using my coursework as content it was a simple case of writing a little bit about myself and answering the coursework questions to upload them onto the website. <br>
As a tie-in to this point this can also mean editing file types or files themselves to make them consistent through your website. The obvious example is converting image types to supported versions and making sure that images of a similar nature or use are the same size (as can be seen on my contact me page <a href="https://matty-ackerley.github.io/mywebsiteproject/contact.html" target="_blank">[10]</a>).</p>
<p>
Testing your website for any errors can be a painstaking process depending on the size of it but is just as important (if not more so) than any other stage. This can consist of making sure all of your links work, all of your images are displayed and your text is formatted correctly.</p>

<div class=subtitle4><h2>UNIT 1, OUTCOME 3 (REVIEW)</h2>
<h3>3.1 REVIEW THE BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF IT TOOLS AND SYSTEMS USED IN TERMS OF PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY – COULD YOU HAVE BEEN MORE EFFICIENT WHEN MAKING YOUR WEBSITE? HOW? COULD YOU HAVE DONE IT IN TEAMS?</h3>
</div>
<div class=panel><p>One of the biggest problems I have found on my website project is that I have pulled myself in too many directions at all once. I am constantly trying to upload my trello, upload new content to my HTML page (and then style it with CSS or Flexbox accordingly), whilst still answering the coursework questions. This can of course be simply down to a lack of experience in projects such as these - knowing the best order to do things in would obviously help and is something I can reflect on at the end of the project</p>

<p>If this was a team project it would have solved this problem by simply assigning each team member certain tasks and having them manage one aspect - allowing them to focus on that.</p></div>

<div class=subtitle4><h3>3.2 DESCRIBE WAYS TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>
Having a clear plan from the beginning is absolutely key. Start by assigning an order to the tasks you need to do based upon priority. Looking back to this website building project, starting with trello as an overall plan and then completing all of the coursework questions possible first would have been best. I could then have put them onto my website with any other pages I wanted to add using HTML and styling them with CSS/Flexbox afterwards.</p>

<p>If you have a deadline it is also important to make sure that you can meet it. If you have features you want to add but may not be 100% certain on, make sure you get everything you can do done first. If you have time left afterwards you can then move onto additionals.</p></div>

<div class=subtitle4><h3>3.3 DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE OWN PRODUCTIVITY USING IT IN DIGITAL PROJECTS – WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY NEXT TIME? TEAM WORK? USE OF SLACK?</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>Using the two projects we have worked on during this course (website building and creating a team game in python) as examples I could certainly make improvements next time around. <br>
For the team game I feel setting a team leader would have been a huge advantage (not something we did first time around). It would allow us to stick to timescales better and make the harder decisions (like when to cut certain things due to time or difficulty constraints). Using websites like Github would have also made a huge difference as it would have allowed us to have one central copy of that game that everybody can add to and test with instead of having one person compile and fix any errors before passing a version to the rest of the team.</p>

<p>For the website project I would make sure to use the software I have chosen correctly and in the right order - as in start with my plan on trello, move onto the content of the website, then do the HTML work finishing with the styling using CSS and Flexbox. Trying to do everything at once made it much more mentally draining and meant that I could not focus completely on the one thing I was working on. </p></div>

<div class=subtitle4><h3>3.4 DESCRIBE HOW YOU WOULD GO ABOUT TESTING DIGITAL SOLUTIONS</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>Uploading my project to websites like Slack or Github and asking people to test them would be an obvious and beneficial step. It would also allow me to request people I may know in the industry (or even friends/family) to give me some constructive criticism on my work.</p>

<p>Self-testing the project as I am building it (and a final thorough test at the end) is also a must. With the team game the final step was to test (it was a multiple choice text-based game) selecting every option we could and making sure that the correct response was given for the option chosen and that there were no dead-ends or breaks.</p></div>

<br><br><br><br>

<div class=subtitle2><h2>UNIT 2 - OUTCOME 1</h2>
<h3>1.5 - DESCRIBING COPYRIGHT AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS AFFECTING WEBSITES.</h3>
</div>
<div class=panel>
<p>
As far as copyright and websites are concerned you should always assume that anything you see on the internet is copyrighted unless you are told otherwise. Any content that is of an original nature (be it images, written works, audio etc) falls under the Copyright law.  Many countries have slight differences (for example in the US logos on a website are protected, while in the UK you would need to register them as trademarks <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/website-copyright-law/#U_K" target="_blank">[11]</a>). There are exceptions such as educational usage that would allow limited personal use.
</p>

<p>Another common constraint on website design would be the end-audience and how they will view the website. This can be from the device they will use (PC, console, mobile) to the size of screen they will use or even the level of zoom they will apply to the website (some browsers scale the images with the text while some do not <a href="https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/site-development/what-are-the-constraints-of-web-page-design/" target="_blank">[12]</a>). This all has to be considered in the planning stage of the website.</p>

<h5>References:<br>

</h5></div>

<div class="subtitle2"><h3>1.6 - DESCRIBING ACCESS ISSUES THAT NEED TAKING INTO ACCOUNT - DESCRIBE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES MAY FACE WHEN USING WEB PAGES AND HOW WE CAN OVERCOME THEM?</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>
A website should always consider the audience that will use it and the necessity for any disabilities such as visual impairment. There are many methods to aid in this, such as an option to enlarge the text size or audio description/commentation. These do not need to be enabled as default but the option to use them should always be there and be clear on how to use it. Websites without this kind of aid may find that people with disabilities are unable to use certain parts of the site, or access key information.</p></div>

<div class="subtitle2"><h3>1.7 - DESCRIBE WHICH ARE THE APPROPRIATE FILE TYPES FOR WEBSITES.</h3></div>
<div class=panel><p>
Deciding upon the most appropriate file type for your website really boils down to what it is you are trying to display. A few examples are described below.
</p>
<p>
If you wanted to display a plain image, then a JPEG would be the most appropriate due to its small file sizes that will not slow down your website loading. 
If you wanted to include a picture with a transparent background then a PNG would be best as JPEGs do not allow this. One drawback with PNGs is that not all browsers support them and on those that do not the image would not load.</p>
<p>
For small animated graphics or animated logos a GIF would be suitable, for longer video and the sort .MP4 would be an option though it would usually be advisable to upload the file to a website like youtube and embed it onto your website.</p>
<p>
For audio files .MP3 is the most commonly used as this allows a small downloadable file size. <a href="https://www.immergetech.com/blog/detail/what-file-format-should-i-upload-to-my-website" target="_blank">[13]</a>
